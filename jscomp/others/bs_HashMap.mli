(** [forEach tbl f] applies [f] to all bindings in table [tbl].
    [f] receives the key as first argument, and the associated value
    as second argument. Each binding is presented exactly once to [f].

    If the hash table was created in non-randomized mode, the order
    in which the bindings are enumerated is reproducible between
    successive runs of the program. *)

    and [d1 ... dN] are the associated values.
    Each binding is presented exactly once to [f].

    The order in which the bindings are passed to [f] is unspecified.
    However, if the table contains several bindings for the same key,
    they are passed to [f] in reverse order of introduction, that is,
    the most recent binding is passed first.

    If the hash table was created in non-randomized mode, the order
    in which the bindings are enumerated is reproducible between
    successive runs of the program, and even between minor versions
    of OCaml.  For randomized hash tables, the order of enumeration
    is entirely random. *)
